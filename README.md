#Nauryz Game

My game project is fully text based game, that consists from three mini games.
Basically, Nauryz is a New Year of turkic nations, thus it has a big celebration.
Three of my games are national games interpretation:
  1. Qyz Quu
  2. Asyq Atu
  3. Otbasym hangman

How to compile:

Since my game consists from multiple files, it requires a bit more steps to compile:
  1. after copying files, open terminal
  2. paste " gcc main.c qyzquu.c asyqatu.c otbasym.c -o game"
  3. then " ./game"
  4. now game should start
